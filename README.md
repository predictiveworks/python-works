# PythonWorks.

Welcome to PredictiveWorks. *Python* branch. PythonWorks. has a strong focus on data science
and illustrates recent project results. This repository was made to be helpful for others and
to provide technical hints in case of poorly documented open source libraries. 

## Earth Observation (EO)

This section introduces (visualization) results from projects related to open EO datasets.

## New European Wind Atlas (NEWA)

This section leverages the NEWA Mesoscale Atlas. The mesoscale part of the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) 
was created from WRF model simulations for all of Europe at a grid spacing of 3 km x 3 km, initially covering
the 30 years from 1989 to 2018. 

The WRF model simulations (using WRF V3.8.1) were done in 10 partly overlapping domains using ERA5 reanalysis 
and OSTIA sea surface temperatures. The model configuration, production and evaluation of the results against 
observations are described in Hahmann et al. (2020) and Dörenkämper et al. (2020). 

The image below visualizes wind speeds in 100 m (above ground) in Germany.
